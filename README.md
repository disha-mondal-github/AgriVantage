# AgriVantage
*AgriVantage* is a web application designed to empower farmers and policymakers in California's Central Valley by leveraging NASA's Earth observation data, specifically focusing on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The application provides a user-friendly platform to visualize real-time data on crop health, water resource management, and environmental changes that directly impact agricultural practices.

## Overview
AgriVantage transforms complex satellite data into actionable insights, enabling farmers to make informed decisions that improve productivity and resource management.

## What We Developed
We developed an interactive web application that features:

- *NDVI for a specific resolution (e.g., 250m)*: Visualization of crop health at a detailed scale.
- *Mean NDVI over time*: Assessment of overall vegetation trends.
- *Changes in NDVI over selected periods*: Insights into crop health fluctuations.
- *Histograms showing the distribution of NDVI values*: Understanding of crop health variability.

## How It Addresses the Challenge
AgriVantage addresses the challenge of providing actionable insights to the agricultural community regarding water-related concerns like droughts and flooding. By transforming complex satellite data into understandable visualizations, it enables farmers to make informed decisions.

## Importance
1. *Food Security*: Enhances food production by optimizing crop management.
2. *Sustainable Practices*: Promotes efficient resource usage.
3. *Accessibility of Data*: Democratizes access to advanced Earth observation data.
4. *Adaptation to Climate Change*: Aids in adapting to changing environmental conditions.

## Features
- User-friendly interface with intuitive navigation.
- Dynamic visualizations and analytical insights.
- Educational resources to deepen user understanding of Earth observation data.
